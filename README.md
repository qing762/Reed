## Reed

Reed is a personal bot that runs on Discord and created by qing762

## Download / Running

I don't recommend to run my script 100% same. It is because you need to change the invite link of the join command. Everything here is provided for educational purposes for discord.py and users that wanted to join coding for a Discord bot.

Nevertheless, the installation steps are as follows:

1. **Install Python 3.8 or higher**
This is required as you need it to launch the bot. **Make sure to tick the add to PATH selection**

2. **Install Discord.py**
Do this by going to your bot directory and type pip install discord.py

3. **Setup**
Navigate to index.py and put your bot token at line 13 (**Inside ''**)

4. **Launch your bot**
C:/Users/YOUR-USERNAME/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python38-32/python.exe c:Users/YOUR-USERNAME/Desktop/reed/index.py
(**Change YOUR-USERNAME to your real username which you can see it by doing Win Key + L, enter the same exact name and this only works for if your file is located on your desktop and the file name is reed**)

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (Python 3.8.1 recommended)
- v1.0.0 of discord.py
